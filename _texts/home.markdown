# Designing for the Digital Age

In an increasingly digital world, designers are often challenged to create technology-driven products and services for a variety of platforms and human needs. Parsons’ Master of Professional Studies in Communication Design (MPS CD) features a concentration in Digital Product Design, which offers you the cutting-edge conceptual design methods and technical skills you need to meet this growing marketplace demand.

# Creative Vision

In this one-year, 30-credit curriculum, you develop creative problem-solving strategies to relay and translate messages, information, and ideas. Your full-time course of study is built on four components: instruction in advanced core design competencies, practices and methods courses, external partnerships, and the core studio sequence. Parsons faculty — skilled at bringing together design thinking, aesthetics, and technology—guide you to explore innovative composition and visualization methods, interaction design, typography, and industry best practices.

# Industry Ready

You graduate from the program with your own unique, forward-looking aesthetic anchored in professional skills acquired throughout the program, which include entrepreneurship, strategic working methodologies, and contemporary prototyping. You are prepared for digital design work settings, with competence in various industry-standard technologies, including front-end development skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and experience navigating professional partnerships with teams and clients.
