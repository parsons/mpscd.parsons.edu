<h1 id="major-studio-1">Major Studio 1</h1> <h5 id="pmcd-5101">PMCD 5101</h5> <h5 id="6-credits">6 Credits</h5> <p>In this course we will examine the fundamentals of digital product design, including user research techniques, production methods for interactive applications, wireframing, and prototyping. We will investigate the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of digital platforms. Students will learn how to design and develop complex digital products and mobile applications as they undertake comprehensive research to direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. Students will utilize tools to conceive, plan, and develop an interactive system, and they will become well versed in their role within the development of interactive media. The course expands on studentsâ€™ existing understanding of programming languages used for digital prototyping.</p> <h1 id="typography-and-interaction-1">Typography and Interaction 1</h1> <h5 id="pmcd-5001">PMCD 5001</h5> <h5 id="2-credits">2 Credits</h5> <p>In this course we will build upon the Typography and Interaction 1 Skills Intensive. Engaging intermediate and advanced methods in typography and interaction design, our goal is to successfully meet the challenges of dynamic content in print and on the web. These comprehensive methods will support students as they work to complete projects in the core studio courses. Students will learn how to address design problems meaningfully within the context of current design practice and technology frameworks, and how individual processes and methodologies influence a design outcome. Students will use their newly acquired design vocabulary to critically discuss and critique work produced by themselves and others.</p> <h1 id="visual-culture-seminar">Visual Culture Seminar</h1> <h5 id="pmcd-5200">PMCD 5200</h5> <h5 id="3-credits">3 Credits</h5> <p>In this seminar we will explore contemporary positions in communication design and discuss its future places in society and industry. The course is an exercise in critical thinking to understand the transformed and expanded nature of globalized visual culture in the 21st century and how design has shifted. Through panel discussions, lectures, and workshops led by industry leaders, researchers, and New School faculty, students will be invited to discuss the cultural landscape of communication design and understand its practices and contemporary working methods. Topics include: counterculture, service design, designer as author, digital craft, social justice and visual narratives, digital storytelling, and digital product design. The diversity of visiting professionals will promote critical interaction with opposing viewpoints as well as provide networking opportunities for students. Students will collaborate in groups to write an essay inflected by one of the lectures or panel discussions that will be published as a microsite.</p> <h1 id="elective">Elective</h1> <h5 id="3-credits-1">3 Credits</h5> <p>Students should explore their elective options with their advisors to create a coherent study plan.</p>
