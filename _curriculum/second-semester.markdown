# Major Studio 2
##### PMCD 5102
##### 6 Credits

In this seminar, we explore contemporary positions in communication design and discuss its future place in society and industry. The course is an exercise in critical thinking in which students come to understand the transformed and expanded nature of globalized visual culture in the 21st century and how design has shifted. Through panel discussions, lectures, and workshops led by industry leaders, researchers, and New School faculty, students are invited to discuss the cultural landscape of communication design and understand its practices and contemporary working methods. Topics covered include counterculture, service design, designer as author, digital craft, social justice and visual narratives, digital storytelling, and digital product design. The diversity of visiting professionals promotes critical interaction with opposing viewpoints and provides networking opportunities for students. Students collaborate in groups to write an essay informed by one of the lectures or panel discussions that will be published as a microsite.

# Typography and Interaction 2
##### PMCD 5002
##### 3 Credits

In this course, we build upon knowledge of dynamic content and interactivity by addressing advanced typographic strategies and interactive skills oriented toward publishing and archiving. Sessions focus on methods relevant to digital production, including content management systems, databases, and responsive workflows. Students apply their understanding of typography and interaction principles to design screen-based projects from start to finish. This course culminates in the production of a functional portfolio site critically informed by studentsâ€™ design practice and developed in tandem with the Methods and Practices class.

# Methods and Practices
##### PMCD 5300
##### 3 Credits

In this course we will explore contemporary working methods and models for communication designers with a focus on digital product design. Students will be exposed to a wide variety of practice models via a series of guest lectures, workshops, and presentations from independent small studios to in-house creative teams and large agencies. As the discipline of design expands, this course attempts to chart novel and alternative working contexts within the industry. Students will discuss professional working processes which include but are not limited to: business communication best practices, business plans, marketing and promotion, bidding, ethics, copyright, editing and packaging work for delivery, and networking.
