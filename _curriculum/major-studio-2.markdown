In this seminar, we explore contemporary positions in communication design and discuss its future place in society and industry. The course is an exercise in critical thinking in which students come to understand the transformed and expanded nature of globalized visual culture in the 21st century and how design has shifted. Through panel discussions, lectures, and workshops led by industry leaders, researchers, and New School faculty, students are invited to discuss the cultural landscape of communication design and understand its practices and contemporary working methods. Topics covered include counterculture, service design, designer as author, digital craft, social justice and visual narratives, digital storytelling, and digital product design. The diversity of visiting professionals promotes critical interaction with opposing viewpoints and provides networking opportunities for students. Students collaborate in groups to write an essay informed by one of the lectures or panel discussions that will be published as a microsite.
