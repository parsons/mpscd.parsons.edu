In this course we will examine the fundamentals of digital product design, including user research techniques, production methods for interactive applications, wireframing, and prototyping. We will investigate the interface, mechanism, controls, and aims of digital platforms. Students will learn how to design and develop complex digital products and mobile applications as they undertake comprehensive research to direct their thinking process from brainstorming to final outcome. Students will utilize tools to conceive, plan, and develop an interactive system, and they will become well versed in their role within the development of interactive media. The course expands on studentsâ€™ existing understanding of programming languages used for digital prototyping.
