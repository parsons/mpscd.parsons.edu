In this course we will build upon the Typography and Interaction 1 Skills Intensive. Engaging intermediate and advanced methods in typography and interaction design, our goal is to successfully meet the challenges of dynamic content in print and on the web. These comprehensive methods will support students as they work to complete projects in the core studio courses. Students will learn how to address design problems meaningfully within the context of current design practice and technology frameworks, and how individual processes and methodologies influence a design outcome. Students will use their newly acquired design vocabulary to critically discuss and critique work produced by themselves and others.
