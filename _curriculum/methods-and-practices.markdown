In this course we will explore contemporary working methods and models for communication designers with a focus on digital product design. Students will be exposed to a wide variety of practice models via a series of guest lectures, workshops, and presentations from independent small studios to in-house creative teams and large agencies. As the discipline of design expands, this course attempts to chart novel and alternative working contexts within the industry. Students will discuss professional working processes which include but are not limited to: business communication best practices, business plans, marketing and promotion, bidding, ethics, copyright, editing and packaging work for delivery, and networking.
