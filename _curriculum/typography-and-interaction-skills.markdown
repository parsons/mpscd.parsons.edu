In this weeklong intensive we will explore intermediate skills and methods to design visual language, form, and interaction. Students will learn how to critically observe and describe visual aspects of language found in analog and digital media, informed by historic typographic precedents, core typographic principles, and contemporary interaction design fundamentals. Additionally, the intensive introduces students to programming within a design context, using code as a means to express ideas formally. Students will practice and utilize a shared vocabulary to critically address how the visual form of language impacts communication, navigation, and behavior in both analog and screen-based media. This intensive experience will prepare students to successfully participate in the subsequent core program classes.
