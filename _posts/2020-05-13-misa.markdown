Misa is a collaborative planning tool that helps groups put together travel itineraries with ease. Misa enables all members of the group to identify categories that interest them and uses that information to put together personalized recommendations for points of interest, restaurants, and activities. The recommendations are saved to a digital pinboard and ordered based on their popularity amongst the group. The pinboard can be edited as needed; it is also a space for all group members to add comments and up- or down-vote pins. Users can also view transportation options and download their itineraries for offline access.
