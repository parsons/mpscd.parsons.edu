True North is a well-being app for professionals to record and track their project experiences. As individuals, they can track how they felt physically, emotionally, intellectually, socially and spiritually during a project. This gives them an overall understanding of what worked and what could be better. They can also write about their takeaways.

The app generates data visualisation via arrows after asking a set of questions to its user. The arrow follows a north star, aka, their true north. The aim of the visual is to understand where they stand in the bigger picture as well as on indivdual projects consisely and quickly. Thus, there are various ways to compare various parameters and understand their professional journey.

As Anne Frank puts it, "whoever is happy will make others happy too,‚Äù The aim of the app is to help indivudals lead a fulfilling profossional life by aligning with their true north and inspire others too.
