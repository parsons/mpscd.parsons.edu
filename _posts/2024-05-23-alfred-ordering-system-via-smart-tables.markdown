Alfred is an ordering system revolutionizing the dining experience with its innovative UI and leveraging smart tables to empower diners. It streamlines restaurant operations by digitizing the dining-in process, and reduces server dependency or wait times, enhancing customer satisfaction. Through deep user research, three key pain points were identified and addressed: inadequate menu information leading to unmet expectations, unnecessary server communication, and awkwardness during bill splitting. Alfred's features include a comprehensive menu system with real-time images, full control in dish customizations, streamlined server communication, easy bill splitting, and different dining modes, all accessible at the touch of a finger. Groovy, an introverted diner allergic to eggs, testifies to Alfred's success in providing control and convenience. Alfred serves as a guide, facilitating interactions seamlessly and allowing restaurants to maintain their identity within the platform with customizable branding options as well.
