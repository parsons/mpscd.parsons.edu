Postcards reframes how we capture and preserve special moments. Each month starts with 36 videos, similar to a disposable camera, encouraging mindfulness in choosing the moments that truly matter. Unlike other apps, Postcards only allows horizontal filming, offering a wider, more cinematic perspective of a memory in a world dominated by vertical videos. It provides features such as collaborating with friends to create shared event albums live, collecting moments from different points of view. With Postcards, re-experience each month with a highlight trailer and build collections of cherished moments, captured the way they deserve to be.
