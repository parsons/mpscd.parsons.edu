AIRE is a smart mirror device that utilizes facial analysis technology that can help detect skin concerns. Once major skin concerns are detected, the smart mirror device will help users generate a skincare routine based on skincare products they already own that can properly address their current problem areas. In a way, AIRE assists with how to accurately layer skincare products to maximize efficiency and results that can help users build confidence through their natural skin.Â
