PureCircle is an app specifically designed for individuals with binge eating disorder (BED). It focuses on How might we help people with BED positively improve their mood and develop healthy eating habits? The app is structured around three main features. The first feature allows users to track their emotional state by writing in a journal or responding to system-generated prompts that assess their mood. It then recommends activities designed to shift their focus and calm their minds. The second feature focuses on fostering the development of healthy, regular meal patterns, addressing the common issue of irregular eating habits among BED sufferers, as evidenced by research. The third feature provides a food logging tool; the app automatically analyzes the nutritional content of the logged meals, offering insights and feedback to help users better monitor and adjust their diet for optimal health.
