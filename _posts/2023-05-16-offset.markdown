Offset focuses on reducing consumer waste to counteract personal carbon footprints by helping users become informed shoppers when the user shops in-store or online. With easy learnability, the app lets aspiring zero-wasters scan barcodes, receive product emission details, and determine what to buy. If the user makes a conscious purchase, they're rewarded with offset points and a personal impact score that details their savings and climate impact.
