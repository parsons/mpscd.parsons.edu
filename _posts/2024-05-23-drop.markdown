"Drop is a drawing app designed to help artists warm-up, get inspired, and loosen up a little, encouraging them to benefit from the joy and therapy of drawing regularly, even if quickly or “badly.”

People can respond to a daily curated prompt by making a “Drop” (solo submission) or by diving into a “Pool” and drawing with others (shared community canvas).

Whether you are looking to refine your drawing skills or are working through a creative drought, Drop will help you find your groove and your people."
