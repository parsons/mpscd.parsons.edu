# v0
Start a new site quickly and easily, using Jekyll.

## Getting started
1. Install the [Jekyll gem] with 'gem install jekyll bundler'
2. Download and unpackage the .zip of v0
3. Navigate to root directory
4. Run `jekyll serve`
5. Compiles to `/_site`
6. Opens at 'http://localhost:4000'
6. Configure `_config.yml`
7. Configure `application.js` to import the JS components you need
8. Configure `application.scss` with project variables and imports for the SCSS components you need
9. configure `fonts.scss`

## Transporting v0
How would you install v0 in an existing project?

## Typography
- philosophy
- workflow
- usage

## Utilities and Layouting
v0 uses Bootstrap 4â€™s Layout and Utilities tools:

- [Bootstrapâ€”Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/)
- [Bootstrapâ€”Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/borders/)

## Differences
- Use `@include sm { ... }` but Bootstrap `@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }` is also supported

## Deprecated
These are still supported but should be phased out in favor of Bootstrap helpers:

- positioning â€“ `u-relative`, etc.
- display â€“ `u-block`, etc.
- spacing â€“ `u-sm-pvlg`, etc.

## To do
+ [ ] add README.md and fill out information like dependencies, running site locally, development workflow, best practices, etc.
+ [ x ] unpackage all the files so theyâ€™re at the top level of the repo. I want to be able to `git status` from the same directory as I run `jekyll serve`
+ [ x ] when I change the SCSS, git is logging all the sass-cache files. Do some research on `.gitignore`
+ [ x ] there are duplicate versions of some files. For instance, `application.scss` exists in multiple places. Also, letâ€™s do a little clean-up on things like `__v0-master`
+ [x] research something that works with Jekyll for compiling all the .js files into `application.js`. On the base v0 (without Jekyll) we use Grunt (or Gulp? ðŸ¤”) to compile that stuff. Maybe Codekit is a good option for us going forward?
